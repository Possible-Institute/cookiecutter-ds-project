## Setting Up OpenAI API

1. Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/).
2. Enter your API key in the `.env` file for the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable.
3. Explore the `notebooks/openai_example.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to see an example of using the OpenAI API.


## Configuration

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the variables with your specific environment settings. Make sure not to commit sensitive data to your version control system.
